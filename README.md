# Indiviual Assignment Two rest-api-demo

The reason there are two files is because I really wanted to get the apikey working <br>
I could never actually get the apikey working so I tried some more stuff <br>
and it still doesn't work, but its definitely better than how I was trying to <br>
do it before. The first folder named Assignment Two is the one I submitted on time <br>
The second folder called CSC-340 is the new changes that still don't work <br>

Make sure jdk verisons match. <br>
run the main method. <br>
